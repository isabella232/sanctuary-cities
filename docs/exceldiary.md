* the main tabula file for cca_managedonly, cca_owned_managed and cca_leased had all three combined together. Cut out the three sections into their own csv-s for easier cleaning. Also stripped random headings like facility name etc manually because there were only a few handful.
    - for cca_leased I appended toprow+bottomrow for two 'years' from 'term' just because these were the only two rows that broke the clean script. The rows were F1 and F16.
